## Description

Integration with Galxe

## Install

  ```
  git clone github.com/rarimo/galxe-svc
  cd galxe-svc
  go build main.go
  export KV_VIPER_FILE=./config.yaml
  ./main run service
  ```

## Documentation

We do use openapi:json standard for API. We use swagger for documenting our API.

To open online documentation, go to [swagger editor](http://localhost:8080/swagger-editor/) here is how you can start it
```
  cd docs
  npm install
  npm start
```
To build documentation use `npm run build` command,
that will create open-api documentation in `web_deploy` folder.

To generate resources for Go models run `./generate.sh` script in root folder.
use `./generate.sh --help` to see all available options.

Note: if you are using Gitlab for building project `docs/spec/paths` folder must not be
empty, otherwise only `Build and Publish` job will be passed.  

## Running from docker 
  
Make sure that docker installed.

use `docker run ` with `-p 8080:80` to expose port 80 to 8080

  ```
  docker build -t github.com/rarimo/galxe-svc .
